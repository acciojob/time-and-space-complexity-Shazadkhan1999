	 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is in handling large datasets.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. An efficient algorithm minimizes unnecessary space usage. <b>Space Complexity</b> can be represented as O(n), where 'n' is the size of the input.</p>
